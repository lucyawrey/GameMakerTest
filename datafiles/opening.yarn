You float formless in the space between.
It is quiet, comfortable, and vast beyond even your comprehension.
But also empty. You are alone. You have been alone for a very long time.
You drift as you always have, for what might be eons or an instant.
Then, you find yourself looking at a glowing speck of something, floating in that eternal void. It feels familiar.
You reach out to touch it.
Then, suddenly, light. It is blinding.
The nothingness that had surrounded you becomes everything all at once and then--
Stella[Dream]: Hey.
Stella[Dream]: It's going to be alright.
Stella[Dream]: You're not going to be alone anymore.
Stella[Dream]: It's so, so hard to keep living, but I'd like it if you tried to once more. If both of us tried.
Stella[Dream]: So, let's go.
Stella[Dream]: Together.

Azalea: Hey Stella, are you awake?
Stella: Um, yeah, I am now. Sorry I passed out.
Azalea: You're good, it's not like you're sleeping in [i]my[/i] caf√© after closing time.
Azalea: I've only been keeping an eye on you, and that's easy to do while I'm here caring for the plants anyways.
Stella: Oh. You didn't have to do that.
Azalea: Probably not, with this city being so safe, and you being... you. But still, it doesn't feel quite right leaving a friend alone in public while they're totally passed out.
Stella: A friend?
Azalea: Yes, obviously.
Stella: Right, sorry. Why didn't you just wake me up?
Azalea: Stella, please, we both know you need whatever sleep you can get.
